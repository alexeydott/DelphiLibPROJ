[PROJ](https://proj.org) is a generic coordinate transformation software that transforms geospatial coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another.

This is a static version of the PROJ4 API (version 5.2) for the windows platform.

Technically it's not a port, it's a linking of c-99 code built by c-builder into delphi.
