[PROJ](https://proj.org) is a generic coordinate transformation software that transforms geospatial coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another.

This is a static version of the PROJ4 API (version 5.2) for the windows platform.
Technically it's a linking of c code built by c-builder into delphi.

The package also includes components for selecting projections and editing their parameters.
